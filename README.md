# Challenge-4---Soccer-Scripting
 Challenge Overview:  Use the skills you learned in the Sumo Battle prototype in a completely different context: the soccer field. Just like in the prototype, you will control a ball by rotating the camera around it and applying a forward force, but instead of knocking them off the edge, your goal is to knock them into the opposing net while they try to get into your net. Just like in the Sumo Battle, after every round a new wave will spawn with more enemy balls, putting your defense to the test. However, almost nothing in this project is functioning! Itâ€™s your job to get it working correctly.
